# Tic-Tac-Toe
A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where players take turns marking 'X' and 'O' on a 3x3 grid. The game checks for a winner after each move and displays a message when a player wins or if it's a draw. The layout is styled with CSS for a clean grid interface, and JavaScript handles the game logic and player interactions.
